## **WARNING: An insulation barrier is required for the Beluga Cold Therapy System.**   

Do not allow direct contact with the skin. Always use an insulation barrier between the skin and the anatomic-specific bladder. Failure to use an insulation barrier can lead to injury. If post-surgery dressing or bandages do not fully cover the skin, place fabric over the bandage for complete coverage. 

## **CAUTION: The bladder is not sterilized; never use on broken or bleeding skin with the Beluga Cold Therapy System.**   

The insulation barrier must be dry. If moisture is present, the skin may become colder than intended. Replace with a dry barrier immediately if moisture is found. 

Stop use and contact your practitioner immediately for any adverse reactions, such as increased pain, burning, itching, swelling, blisters, redness, discoloration, welts, or any other reaction identified by your practitioner. Always follow your doctor's directions regarding treatment time, cycles, and skin inspection. 

## **Tips and Pearls for the Beluga Cold Therapy System** 

1. **Frozen Water Bottles:**   
Swap ice cubes for frozen water bottles to avoid water overflow and for easy replacement. 

2. **White Quick Connections:**   
Ensure the wrap's white quick connections to the blue extension hose are secure; they have check valves that stop water flow if not fully connected. 

3. **Avoid Kinks:**   
Make sure there are no kinks in the tubing and wraps; the pump can't overcome these. 

4. **Bypassing the Switch (Optional):**   
To have the pump run continuously, plug the power supply directly into the cooler. Always adhere to your doctor's advice on run and rest times. 

You're all set to enjoy the benefits of your Beluga Arctic Flow Therapy System.
